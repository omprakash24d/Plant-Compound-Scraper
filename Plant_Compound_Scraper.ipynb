        "# Documentation for Plant Compound Scraper\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "This Python script automates the extraction of natural products from the **COCONUT** database and retrieves molecular properties from **PubChem**. The program uses **Selenium** for web scraping and **requests** for API calls. Extracted data is saved to a CSV file.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dependencies\n",
        "Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the script:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "pip install selenium webdriver-manager pandas tqdm requests\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "- Scrapes **COCONUT** for natural products related to user-provided plant names.\n",
        "- Fetches molecular properties from **PubChem**, including:\n",
        "  - Molecular Formula\n",
        "  - Molecular Weight\n",
        "  - IUPAC Name\n",
        "  - Canonical SMILES\n",
        "  - Compound CID\n",
        "- Uses **ThreadPoolExecutor** for efficient parallel processing.\n",
        "- Saves extracted data into a CSV file for easy access.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Best Practices to Ensure Optimal Results\n",
        "1. **Ensure Correct Spelling of Plant Names**: Incorrect spellings can lead to no results or incorrect data.\n",
        "2. **Run in a Stable Network Environment**: The script relies on API calls and web scraping, which need stable internet connectivity.\n",
        "3. **Use a Headless Browser for Performance**: The script is optimized for Google Colab with `--headless` mode enabled.\n",
        "4. **Avoid Overloading Servers**: Excessive requests may lead to temporary bans. Keep `time.sleep(2)` to prevent this.\n",
        "5. **Verify Data Integrity**: Check the CSV output for missing or incorrect values before proceeding with analysis.\n",
        "6. **Keep ChromeDriver Updated**: Use `webdriver-manager` to always fetch the latest ChromeDriver version.\n",
        "7. **Monitor Errors and Logs**: The script prints error messages for debugging in case of failures.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Script Breakdown\n",
        "### 1. `setup_driver()`\n",
        "Initializes the **Selenium WebDriver** for scraping data from **COCONUT**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. `scrape_coconut_database(plant_name: str) -> List[str]`\n",
        "Searches for compounds related to the input plant in the **COCONUT** database and extracts their names.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. `fetch_pubchem_properties(compound_name: str) -> Tuple[str, str, str, str]`\n",
        "Queries **PubChem** for molecular properties using the **PUG REST API**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. `fetch_pubchem_cid(compound_name: str) -> str`\n",
        "Retrieves the **Compound ID (CID)** for a given compound from **PubChem**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. `save_results_to_csv(data: Dict[str, List[str]], filename: str)`\n",
        "Saves the extracted data into a **CSV file**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. `process_compound(plant: str, compound: str, extracted_data: Dict[str, List[str]])`\n",
        "Processes each compound in parallel using **ThreadPoolExecutor**.\n",
        "\n",

        "## Output\n",
        "A **CSV file (`natural_products.csv`)** containing extracted data with the following columns:\n",
        "- **Plant**: Name of the input plant.\n",
        "- **Compound**: Extracted compound name.\n",
        "- **CID**: PubChem Compound ID.\n",
        "- **MolecularFormula**: Chemical formula.\n",

        "## Error Handling\n",
        "- If a compound is **not found** on PubChem, `N/A` is recorded.\n",
        "- **Exceptions** during scraping or API calls are logged with appropriate messages.\n",
